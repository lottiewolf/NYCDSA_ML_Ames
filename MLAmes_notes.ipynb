    "\n",
    "The goal of building a predictive model is to predict the house prices accurately (just like Zillow home price estimates), rather than to understand the housing market dynamics. So the so-called **black box** models can be considered if they offer better accuracies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because the number of features is large, multi-collinearity plagues multiple linear regression.\n",
    "- Ridge, Lasso, and linear kernel SVR are popular choices to start your research.\n",
    "- Use Lasso for feature selection if it is warranted.\n",
    "- On the other hand, non-linear models, particularly tree-based models, are popular choices.\n",
    "- **Ensembles**: If you train multiple models, you can put them into an ensemble to improve accuracies.\n",
    "- If you borrow your insights in data analysis to generate new features, be sure to prevent **data-leakage**, i.e. you avoid using the cv test set house price values in your feature engineering analysis."

Please advise him regarding the price ranges and the target neighborhoods for better schools.\n",
